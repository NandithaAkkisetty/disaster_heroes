# disaster_heroes
our team is excited to present our project "Disaster Heroes." Our mission is to bridge the gap in disaster preparedness among school kids through a captivating gamified learning experience.

With "Disaster Heroes," we aim to achieve several objectives. Firstly, we want to educate school kids about various disaster management techniques. By presenting the information in a gamified format, we make learning enjoyable and engaging, enhancing retention and understanding of the subject matter.

Secondly, our game focuses on skill development. We want to empower school kids with essential skills such as decision-making, critical thinking, problem-solving, and resource management. Through challenging scenarios and strategic choices, players will enhance their abilities to respond effectively to disasters.

Another important objective is to raise awareness and foster preparedness. We believe in instilling a sense of responsibility and a proactive mindset in school kids. By playing "Disaster Heroes," they will learn the importance of taking actions that contribute to their own safety and the well-being of their communities.

Engagement and motivation are key factors in our project. We want to keep school kids hooked and motivated throughout the learning process. By incorporating interactive gameplay, rewards, and progression elements, we ensure sustained interest, continuous learning, and a positive attitude towards disaster management.

What sets "Disaster Heroes" apart are its unique selling points. We offer a gamified learning experience that combines education and entertainment. Our game covers a wide range of comprehensive disaster management techniques, including preparedness, response, and recovery strategies. The content and difficulty levels are tailored to different age groups, ensuring an age-appropriate experience. Realistic simulations of disaster scenarios enable school kids to make critical decisions and witness the consequences of their choices. We also provide supplementary educational resources within the game, including guides, tips, and real-life examples.

To bring this project to life, we have chosen Unity and C# as our frontend tech stack, with a possibility of incorporating a DBMS like MySQL for the backend as the project progresses.

Stay tuned for more updates on our journey as we work towards creating an engaging and impactful learning experience in disaster management for school kids.
